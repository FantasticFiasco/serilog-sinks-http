## Unreleased

### :zap: Added

- [#116](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/serilog-sinks-http/issues/116) [BREAKING CHANGE] Support specifying `batchSizeLimitBytes` when creating the sink, thus limiting the size of the payloads sent to the log server (proposed by [@michaeltdaniels](https://github.com/michaeltdaniels))

**Migration guide**

By far the easiest way to migrate your code is to stop using positional arguments and instead use named arguments.

If you use the non-durable sink please make the following changes to your code.

```csharp
// Before migration
log = new LoggerConfiguration()
  .WriteTo.Http("https://www.mylogs.com", 500, 500)
  .CreateLogger();

// After migration
log = new LoggerConfiguration()
  .WriteTo.Http(
    requestUri: "https://www.mylogs.com",
    batchPostingLimit: 500,
    // the new argument batchSizeLimitBytes is positioned here
    queueLimit: 500)
  .CreateLogger();
```

If you use the durable file size rolled sink please make the following changes to your code.

```csharp
// Before migration
log = new LoggerConfiguration()
  .WriteTo.DurableHttpUsingFileSizeRolledBuffers(
      "https://www.mylogs.com",
      "MyBuffer",
      ByteSize.GB,
      false,
      10,
      500,
      TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10))
  .CreateLogger();

// After migration
log = new LoggerConfiguration()
  .WriteTo.DurableHttpUsingFileSizeRolledBuffers(
      requestUri: "https://www.mylogs.com",
      bufferBaseFileName: "MyBuffer",
      bufferFileSizeLimitBytes: ByteSize.GB,
      bufferFileShared: false,
      retainedBufferFileCountLimit: 10,
      batchPostingLimit: 500,
      // the new argument batchSizeLimitBytes is positioned here
      period: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10))
  .CreateLogger();
```

If you use the durable time rolled sink please make the following changes to your code.

```csharp
// Before migration
log = new LoggerConfiguration()
  .WriteTo.DurableHttpUsingTimeRolledBuffers(
      "https://www.mylogs.com",
      "MyBuffer-{Date}.json",
      ByteSize.GB,
      false,
      10,
      500,
      TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10))
  .CreateLogger();

// After migration
log = new LoggerConfiguration()
  .WriteTo.DurableHttpUsingTimeRolledBuffers(
      requestUri: "https://www.mylogs.com",
      bufferPathFormat: "MyBuffer-{Date}.json",
      bufferFileSizeLimitBytes: ByteSize.GB,
      bufferFileShared: false,
      retainedBufferFileCountLimit: 10,
      batchPostingLimit: 500,
      // the new argument batchSizeLimitBytes is positioned here
      period: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10))
  .CreateLogger();
```

- [#166](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/serilog-sinks-http/issues/166) Support for content encoding [Gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) using HTTP client `JsonGzipHttpClient` (contribution by [@vaibhavepatel](https://github.com/vaibhavepatel), [@KalininAndreyVictorovich](https://github.com/KalininAndreyVictorovich) and [@AntonSmolkov](https://github.com/AntonSmolkov))

### :dizzy: Changed

- [#166](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/serilog-sinks-http/issues/166) [BREAKING CHANGE] Interface `IHttpClient` has changed to accommodate for different HTTP content types

**Migration guide**

You will have to migrate your code if you've implemented your own version of `IHttpClient`. The signature of method `IHttpClient.PostAsync` has changed from `Task<HttpResponseMessage> PostAsync(string, HttpContent)` to `Task<HttpResponseMessage> PostAsync(string, Stream)`.

```csharp
// Before migration
public class MyHttpClient : IHttpClient
{
  // Code removed for brevity...

  public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> PostAsync(string requestUri, HttpContent content)
  {
    // Here you probably have some code updating the content,
    // and then you send the request
    return await httpClient.PostAsync(requestUri, content)
  }
}

// After migration
public class MyHttpClient : IHttpClient
{
  // Code removed for brevity...

  public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> PostAsync(string requestUri, Stream contentStream)
  {
    using (var content = new StreamContent(contentStream))
    {
      content.Headers.Add("Content-Type", "application/json");

      // Here you probably have some code updating the content,
      // and then you send the request
      return await httpClient.PostAsync(requestUri, content)
    }
  }
}
```

- [#162](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/serilog-sinks-http/issues/162) [BREAKING CHANGE] Deprecated dependency [Serilog.Sinks.RollingFile](https://www.nuget.org/packages/serilog.sinks.rollingfile) has been removed (discovered by [@tipasergio](https://github.com/tipasergio))

**Migration guide**

You will have to migrate your code if you're using `DurableHttpUsingTimeRolledBuffers`, i.e. use the durable HTTP sink with a rolling behavior defined by a time interval. The parameter `bufferPathFormat` has been renamed to `bufferBaseFileName`, and the parameter `bufferRollingInterval` has been added.

Given you are configuring the sink in code you should do the following changes.

```csharp
// Before migration
log = new LoggerConfiguration()
  .WriteTo.DurableHttpUsingTimeRolledBuffers(
    requestUri: "https://www.mylogs.com",
    bufferPathFormat: "MyBuffer-{Hour}.json")
  .CreateLogger();

// After migration
log = new LoggerConfiguration()
  .WriteTo.DurableHttpUsingTimeRolledBuffers(
    requestUri: "https://www.mylogs.com",
    bufferBaseFileName: "MyBuffer",
    bufferRollingInterval: BufferRollingInterval.Hour)
  .CreateLogger();
```

Given you are configuring the sink in application configuration you should do the following changes.

```json
// Before migration
{
  "Serilog": {
    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "DurableHttpUsingTimeRolledBuffers",
        "Args": {
          "requestUri": "https://www.mylogs.com",
          "bufferPathFormat": "MyBuffer-{Hour}.json"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

// After migration
{
  "Serilog": {
    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "DurableHttpUsingTimeRolledBuffers",
        "Args": {
          "requestUri": "https://www.mylogs.com",
          "bufferBaseFileName": "MyBuffer",
          "bufferRollingInterval": "Hour"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- [#206](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/serilog-sinks-http/issues/206) [BREAKING CHANGE] Argument `bufferFileSizeLimitBytes` to extension methods `DurableHttpUsingFileSizeRolledBuffers` and `DurableHttpUsingTimeRolledBuffers` no longer accepts `0` as value

### :skull: Removed

- [#182](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/serilog-sinks-http/issues/182) Extension method `DurableHttp` which was marked as deprecated in v5.2.0

**Migration guide**

Given you are configuring the sink in code you should do the following changes.

```csharp
// Before migration
log = new LoggerConfiguration()
  .WriteTo.DurableHttp(requestUri: "https://www.mylogs.com")
  .CreateLogger();

// After migration
log = new LoggerConfiguration()
  .WriteTo.DurableHttpUsingTimeRolledBuffers(requestUri: "https://www.mylogs.com")
  .CreateLogger();
```

Given you are configuring the sink in application configuration you should do the following changes.

```json
// Before migration
{
  "Serilog": {
    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "DurableHttp",
        "Args": {
          "requestUri": "https://www.mylogs.com"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

// After migration
{
  "Serilog": {
    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "DurableHttpUsingTimeRolledBuffers",
        "Args": {
          "requestUri": "https://www.mylogs.com"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### :zap: Added

- [#3](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/serilog-sinks-http/issues/3) Support for configuring a sink to be durable using `Http(string, DurableOptions)`. A durable sink will persist log events on disk before sending them over the network, thus protecting against data loss after a system or process restart.

### :dizzy: Changed

- [BREAKING CHANGE] The syntax for creating a non-durable sink has been changed from `Http(string)` to `Http(string, Options)` to accommodate for the syntax to create a durable sink. A non-durable sink will lose data after a system or process restart.
- Improve compatibility by supporting .NET Standard 1.3

## [2.0.0] - 2016-11-23

### :dizzy: Changed

- [#1](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/serilog-sinks-http/pull/1) [BREAKING CHANGE] Sinks can be configured to use a custom implementation of `IHttpClient` (contribution by [@lhaussknecht](https://github.com/lhaussknecht))
