## Unreleased

### Added

- Support for the formatting types: `FormattingType.NormalRendered`, `FormattingType.Normal`, `FormattingType.CompactRendered` and `FormattingType.Compact`. The formatting type can be configured via `Options` and `DurableOptions`.

## 3.0.0 2017-03-04

### Added

- A sink is durable when created using `Http(string, DurableOptions)`. A durable sink will persist log events on disk before sending them over the network, thus protecting against data loss after a system or process restart.

### Changed

- [BREAKING CHANGE] The syntax for creating a non-durable sink has been changed from `Http(string)` to `Http(string, Options)` to accommodate for the syntax to create a durable sink. A non-durable sink will loose data after a system or process restart.
- Improve compatibility by supporting .NET Standard 1.3

## 2.0.0 2016-11-23

### Changed
